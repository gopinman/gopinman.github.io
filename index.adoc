== GDB Tips

=== Debugging core using gdb
---
Core file limit should be unlimited to generate the core in linux, to set core file limit execute the below command on shell

 >> $ulimit -c unlimited

Once this is done the core is generated in the current directory of the process but we can also change the core  name and path by changing  it in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

 >> $echo /home/gopinman/mycore > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

Once above setting is done the core file would be generated at /home/gopinman/mycore.pid (process ID of process that generated Core file)

---

=== Compliation option for gdb
---

Binary/library should be complied with debugging option to use it with gdb, debugging option is enabled using -g complier option

 >> $g++ -g -o cppfilename.o -lpthread cppfilename.cpp

The above compilation will generate the un-stripped binary with debugging option, this information can be retrieved using file command

 >> $file cppfilename.o

Remember if the core is generated from stripped binary then re-compile the binary with debug options and pass the debug binary and core as 
parameters to gdb on command shell as below.

In multi-threaded environment you will have multiple stack snap shot for each thread, using below command we can dump the stack trace for multiple threads

 >> $thread apply all bt

the output of above command will dump the stack frames for all the threads in a process
To switch between threads use "thread <number>"command
 >> $thread 1

after switchover stack of current thread can be dumped with bt command. We can inspect each frame using frame <number>, frame 0
 >> $list +

list+ will show the source for the stack dump
 >> $print variable 

---

=== Debugging a Hang process
---
A process hang due to deadlocks can be made to generate core dump by kill command. Signal number 11 should be used

 >> $kill -11 pid
